# Spotify Web App 

This project is basically me messing around with basic web design, with the vague end goal of being able to automatically generate Spotify playlists based on user metadata -- for example, I would like to be able to generate a playlist of my Top 20 songs from the last month, or my Top 100 songs of all time. 

This is all being done through the [Spotify Web Api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).
